ISSUES:

* First image needs a caption on: portfolio-desktop.html
* See if I can maybe get the code window on the best practices page to
  be smaller on mobile. Having a hard time with this one. Could either skip, or don't show it on phones.
* On mobile, images opened in modals don't really get any bigger in landscape.
  They sometimes get smaller. Is this something I can fix?

MAYBE:

* Maybe convert px values (at least for typography) to viewport units (vw, vh) If I try this, it should be
  in its own branch.
* Consider using something like this: https://github.com/wilddeer/stickyfill
  for sticking a section header when scrolling down.
