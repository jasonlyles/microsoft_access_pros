BEFORE RELEASE:

* First image needs a caption on: portfolio-desktop.html
* See if I can maybe get the code window on the best practices page to
  be smaller on mobile. Having a hard time with this one. Could either skip, or don't show it on phones.
* On mobile, images opened in modals don't really get any bigger. In landscape on my phone,
  they don't fill up the available space.

BEFORE HANDING OVER TO BRAD:

* Before I can hand this over to Brad, I need to figure out some way of doing header, nav, footer partials,
  and generating files using those partials. Part of that would be figuring out which nav item was active.
  Could maybe just be a simple Ruby script that pulls those files and generates the html files. Would maybe
  also want to dynamically add references to css and js files.

MAYBE:

* Maybe convert px values (at least for typography) to viewport units (vw, vh) If I try this, it should be
  in its own branch.
* Consider using something like this: https://github.com/wilddeer/stickyfill
  for sticking a section header when scrolling down.
